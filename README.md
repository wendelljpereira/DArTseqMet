# Computational protocol for the analysis of DArTseqMet data.

This repository contains the source code necessary to analyze DArTseqMet data, identifying the DNA methylations present in a sample on a genome-wide scale.

The method described here was first described in the paper ["A cost-effective approach to DNA methylation detection by Methyl Sensitive DArT sequencing."](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.10305431). Later, the same approach was used to investigate DNA methylation in clones of _Eucalyptus grandis_ planted in contrasting environments, as described in the paper ["Patterns of DNA methylation changes in elite Eucalyptus clones across contrasting environments"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118319).

## Installation

This computational protocol is designed to be executed using the [Snakemake workflow management system](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
